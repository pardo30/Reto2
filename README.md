#GoalKeeper Game
Bootcamp Frontend React Online GeeksHubs Academy

This is a drag and drop game. The whole net is divided in 6 rectangle where the user can drop the ball. The goalkeeper movement in these 6 rectangles is defined by Math.random funtion. 

If both data are the same means the goalkeeper SAVE IT!, else it's a GOAL!

Enjoy it!
